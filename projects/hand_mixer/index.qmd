## Project Overview

This project aimed to modernize an existing design by enhancing its appearance and implementing mechanical improvements for better functionality.

### Key Features of the Next Generation Design

The benchmark design for this next generation model is the SMEG Hand Mixer HMF01. After examining the reviews placed by consumers, it was clear that many features were well-loved, but others still had room for improvement. Based on these reviews and personal experience, some changes that I decided to make for the Next-Generation of the SMEG Hand Mixer include:

1. An eject button for taking the beaters out instead of an eject switch, allowing for easier access and a smoother eject process.
1. An included charger case so the cord doesn’t get in the way during use, transitioning the mixer to be powered by a rechargeable battery.
1. An included bowl rest located near the bottom back of the mixer so that a user can set the mixer on the edge of the bowl when not in use.
1. A larger surface area on the ergonomic grip (a highly rated feature).
1. An included storage case (combined with charger case) so the user can easily keep track of attachments.
1. A styling update, including a flatter handle that doesn’t connect back into the body at the back.
1. Modernization, including an updated button / screen interface.

The next generation design also keeps recognizable and consumer approved features of the original design, namely:

* The same approximate size
* The smooth, retro look
* The self-balancing design
* The nine speed options and LED display with set timer

After deciding what changes to make for the next generation design, I began sketching ideas to implement each design change. Once I had chosen a design, I moved into the 3D modeling phase.

I began by sketching the steps for each part of the mixer. Then, using the parametric modeling platform *Onshape*, I created my model. 

* Most parts in the assembly were created using a master model and offset surfaces. 
* The body of the master model was created with a revolve. 
* The handle was formed using a complex loft that follows a guide curve.

During the iterative modeling process, I conducted a series of computational validations to ensure manufacturing readiness:

* **Interference Testing:** Verified that all internal gear meshes and housing tolerances were intentional, preventing mechanical clashing.
* **Thickness Analysis:** Confirmed constant wall thickness across the chassis to facilitate high-quality injection molding.
* **Zebra Striping:** Evaluated surface continuity to ensure light reflections flow smoothly across the curves of the mixer.


##### Documentation

The final step after hours of parametric modeling was to document my work. This includes the creation of engineering drawings and the complilation of a design package.
