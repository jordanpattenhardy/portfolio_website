    "text": "Intro\nEvery year on February 2nd, thousands gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, awaiting the spring forecast from the world’s most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil. According to tradition, if Phil sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter are expected. However, if he doesn’t see his shadow, an early spring is on the way.\nWhile the event is a beloved cultural ritual, many question the accuracy of Phil’s predictions. Is there any truth behind the shadow-based forecasting, or is it simply superstition? To investigate, I analyzed historical average temperature data alongside Phil’s annual predictions to evaluate whether his forecasts align with actual weather patterns. Leaning toward belief rather than skepticism, I hypothesized that Punxsutawney Phil is correct more than half of the time."

The alternative hypothesis was that he is correct more than 50% of the time. I set conditions for a “correct” prediction and analyzed the data under four different thresholds for defining winter (a difference of 0°C (no change), the mean of the distribution (7.88℉ increase), the median (7.96℉ increase), the 25th percentile (5.29℉ increase) ). Using if statements in Python, I determined whether each prediction was correct according to the defined threshold, and calculated the proportion of correct predictions for each method. For hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, I used norm.cdf or norm.ppf from the scipy.stats library."

Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and cannot conclude that Phil’s predictions are correct more than 50 percent of the time. It appears that Punxsutawney Phil’s predictions do not significantly outperform random chance under any of the thresholds tested. While the folklore is entertaining and charming, the data suggests that Phil may not be a reliable source of meteorological insight. Similarly, the calculated confidence intervals provide a region in which we can be 95% confident that the true population proportion of correct predictions lies.\nView the complete report here"

    "text": "Introduction\nEvery year on February 2nd, thousands gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, awaiting the spring forecast from the world’s most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil. According to tradition, if Phil sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter are expected. However, if he doesn’t see his shadow, an early spring is on the way.\nWhile the event is a beloved cultural ritual, many question the accuracy of Phil’s predictions. Is there any truth behind the shadow-based forecasting, or is it simply superstition? To investigate, I analyzed historical average temperature data alongside Phil’s annual predictions to evaluate whether his forecasts align with actual weather patterns. Leaning toward belief rather than skepticism, I hypothesized that Punxsutawney Phil is correct more than half of the time."

I modeled a swing set crossbeam as a simply supported beam under a center load to identify the materials that met a maximum deflection limit of 0.5 mm. I compared several materials for stiffness, weight, cost, and durability, then created a graph and table in Excel to visualize performance and determine the optimal material under given the design constraints.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dan Meyers on Unsplash"

As a result of our team’s design modifications, the engine operated at a lower PSI than any of the other team’s engines built from the same initial design and specifications. Afterwards, we compiled a prototyping package, including detailed engineering drawings and process sheets for each part.\n\n\n\n\nExample Documentation\n\n\n\nWe also compiled a comprehensive design report, which included documentation of implemented design changes and recommendations for future improvements given investment casting and CNC Mill/Lathe as process options. Then, we created more engineerings drawings that documented the changes we suggested for each part for future iterations. These new models and drawings were created using SolidWorks.\n\nView the complete prototyping package here\nView the complete design report here"
