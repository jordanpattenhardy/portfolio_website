    "section": "",
    "text": "This project aimed to modernize an existing design by enhancing its appearance and implementing mechanical improvements for better functionality.\n\n\n\nComparison between Current Generation Smeg Hand Mixer and Next Generation Design\n\n\n\n\nThe benchmark design for this next generation model is the SMEG Hand Mixer HMF01. After examining the reviews placed by consumers, it was clear that many features were well-loved, but others still had room for improvement. Based on these reviews and personal experience, some changes that I decided to make for the Next-Generation of the SMEG Hand Mixer include:\n\nAn eject button for taking the beaters out instead of an eject switch, allowing for easier access and a smoother eject process.\nAn included charger case so the cord doesn’t get in the way during use, transitioning the mixer to be powered by a rechargeable battery.\nAn included bowl rest located near the bottom back of the mixer so that a user can set the mixer on the edge of the bowl when not in use.\nA larger surface area on the ergonomic grip (a highly rated feature).\nAn included storage case (combined with charger case) so the user can easily keep track of attachments.\nA styling update, including a flatter handle that doesn’t connect back into the body at the back.\nModernization, including an updated button / screen interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParts of Completed Assembly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Features of Next-Gen Design\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next generation design also keeps recognizable and consumer approved features of the original design, namely:\n\nThe same approximate size\nThe smooth, retro look\nThe self-balancing design\nThe nine speed options and LED display with set timer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeation Sketches\n\n\n\n\nAfter deciding what changes to make for the next generation design, I began sketching ideas to implement each design change. Once I had chosen a design, I moved into the 3D modeling phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI began by sketching the steps for each part of the mixer. Then, using the parametric modeling platform Onshape, I created my model.\n\nMost parts in the assembly were created using a master model and offset surfaces.\nThe body of the master model was created with a revolve.\nThe handle was formed using a complex loft that follows a guide curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThickness AnalysisInjection Molding Prep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference Check Mechanical Clearances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZebra AnalysisCurvature Continuity\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the iterative modeling process, I conducted a series of computational validations to ensure manufacturing readiness:\n\nInterference Testing: Verified that all internal gear meshes and housing tolerances were intentional, preventing mechanical clashing.\nThickness Analysis: Confirmed constant wall thickness across the chassis to facilitate high-quality injection molding.\nZebra Striping: Evaluated surface continuity to ensure light reflections flow smoothly across the curves of the mixer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering Drawings\n\n\n\n\nThe final step after hours of parametric modeling was to document my work.
